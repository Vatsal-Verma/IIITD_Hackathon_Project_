# MedVision ‚Äì AI-Powered Healthcare for Social Good

## üß† Inspiration  
Many people suffer due to limited access to doctors, wrong medications, or lack of knowledge about safe exercises. We wanted to create a solution that could help people make better health decisions using technology. Our goal was to make healthcare more accessible, safer, and smarter for everyone.

## üí° What It Does  
MedVision is an AI-powered healthcare platform designed to support people in multiple ways:
- Users can **book appointments** with real doctors.  
- If a doctor is not available, an **AI virtual doctor** provides basic health advice.  
- The platform checks if a medicine is **safe based on user allergies** by analyzing its salts.  
- It also features a **human body simulator** that shows which exercises target specific muscles, promoting safe and effective workouts.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It  
We used modern web technologies to create the platform:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js)  
- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot for APIs  
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing user, appointment, and medicine data  
- **AI Integration:** Used a natural language model to assist with doctor queries  
- **Medicine Safety Checker:** Built a salt-allergy database and matching logic  
- **Human Simulator:** Integrated a visual model to show muscle groups and related exercises  

## üöß Challenges We Faced  
- Matching medicine salts with allergy data accurately  
- Making the AI responses both helpful and safe  
- Building a clean and interactive human body simulator  
- Ensuring a smooth user experience across all features  

## üèÜ Accomplishments We're Proud Of  
- Built a fully functional AI assistant for basic health advice  
- Developed a system to detect medicine allergies  
- Created a muscle-wise exercise guide using a body simulator  
- Made a user-friendly healthcare tool that can help real people  

## üìö What We Learned  
- How to integrate AI into real-world healthcare tools  
- Handling health-related data with care and accuracy  
- Designing user experiences for both tech-savvy and non-tech users
